# How to use this on your iPhone

Since "localhost" only exists on your computer, your iPhone needs to use your computer's "Network Address" to talk to it.

### Step 1: Same Wi-Fi
Make sure your iPhone is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as this Mac (`GoogleGuest` or similar).

### Step 2: The Magic Link
Open Safari on your iPhone and type this exactly:

**http://10.20.17.247:8501**

### Step 3: Save as an "App"
To get the full app experience (without the browser bar):
1. While on the page in Safari, tap the **Share** button (box with an arrow up).
2. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
3. Name it "Fitness Tracker" and tap **Add**.

Now you have a proper icon on your home screen! 📱

### Important Note
Your Mac must be **turned on** and **running the app code** for the link to work on your phone. If you close the terminal or put the Mac to sleep, the app will stop working on your phone.
